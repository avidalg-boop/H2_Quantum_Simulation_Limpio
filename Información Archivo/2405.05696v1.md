#### Abstract

Various aspects of entropy of a complicated cavity QED system are explored. Atoms are held in optical cavities through optical tweezers and can jump between different cavities through the tunneling effect. The interaction of atom with the cavity results in electronic transitions and the creation and annihilation of photon. Covalent bond and phonon are introduced into the model. The effect of all kinds of interactions on entropy is studied. At the same time, the von Neumann entropy of different subsystems is compared. The results show that by selectively choosing system parameters, the entropic dynamics can be controlled.


Keywords: entropic dynamics, finite-dimensional QED, artificial atom, covalent bond, phonon.

## I. INTRODUCTION

The idea of entropy was initially introduced to thermodynamics in 1865 by Clausius 1. Subsequently, Boltzmann established the relationship between entropy and the system's microscopic characteristics and gave it statistical significance. Entropy is a measure of the degree of disorder in a microscopic system used in statistical physics. In 1929, Szilard provided an explanation of the connection between information and entropy. Entropy is used as a measure of information in information theory. Later, von Neumann expanded classical entropy to the quantum domain [2]. And entropy is used to investigate entanglement in the interaction between light and matter 3-8). Shannon then developed information theory based on Boltzmann's classical entropy [9]. On the other hand, the phenomena of quantum entanglement has garnered a lot of attention with the advancement of quantum mechanics and the founding of quantum information science. Einstein and other scientists were the first to observe the phenomena of quantum entanglement [10, 11. Quantum entanglement is currently widely applied in quantum communications and quantum information processing. Measuring the quantum entanglement between two-body pure state systems is one of the key functions of quantum entropy. To this day, the quantum entropy can be found using a variety of quantifiers, including information entropy 12-14, conditional entropy 15, 16, relative entropy [17, compressed entropy [18, 19, differential entropy [20, etc 21,29. In recent years, the wide application of quantum entropy theory in the fields of quantum optics and quantum information has attracted great attention. It is the theoretical basis and powerful tool for understanding hot topics of quantum mechanics and quantum informatics $30-35$.

A key contribution of this research is the model of quantum electrodynamics (QED), which offers a unique scientific framework for studying the interaction between matter and light. Fields of cavities in this paradigm

[^0]are coupled to impurity two- or multi-level structures, usually called atoms. The Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM) 36 and Tavis-Cummings model (TCM) 37. and their generalizations - Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard model (JCHM) and Tavis-Cummings-Hubbard model (TCHM) 38, which are usually easier to achieve in experiment, are the most researched cavity QED models. Recent years have seen a significant amount of study in the field of cavity QED models 39 49. There are some applications for entropy in quantum computations. Nevertheless, prior research has primarily focused on entropic dynamics in sample cavity QED systems, with a rare exception of more complicated systems. Consequently, it is imperative to examine entropic dynamics in complicated systems.

Since von Neumann entropy has so many uses and special characteristics, we employ it to calculate entropy in this paper. We investigate von Neumann entropy in the bipartite system, based on the TCHM. This paper is organized as follows. After introducing the target model in Sec. II, we introduce numerical method in Sec. III. We present the effect of interactions on entropy and comparison of entropy of different subsystems in Secs. IV A and IV B, respectively. Some brief comments on our results and extension to future work in Sec. V close out the paper.

## II. THE NEUTRAL HYDROGEN MOLECULE ASSOCIATION-DISSOCIATION MODEL WITH COVALENT BOND AND PHONON

The association-dissociation model of the neutral hydrogen molecule, studied in detail in our previous work on quantum evolution [46, is modified from the TCHM. In this paper, we directly quote the model called the neutral hydrogen molecule association-dissociation model with covalent bond and phonon from [46] and study the entropy dynamics in the non-dissipative case.

There are two hydrogen atoms in the model, which form hydrogen bond through orbital hybridization and release a phonon. On the contrary, when the hydrogen

FIG. 1. (online color) The model with covalent bond and phonon. When atoms are in distinct cavities depicted in panel (a), hybridization of atomic orbitals is prohibited; however, when atoms are in the same cavity depicted in panel (b), hybridization of atomic orbitals is allowed. As atomic orbitals hybridize, a covalent bond is formed and a phonon is released; conversely, when a covalent bond is broken, a phonon is absorbed. In panel (c), according to Eqs. (2), $\left|\Psi_{\text {initial }}\right\rangle$ can be decomposed into the sum of four states $\left|\Phi_{0}^{\uparrow} \Phi_{0}^{\downarrow}\right\rangle,\left|\Phi_{1}^{\uparrow} \Phi_{0}^{\downarrow}\right\rangle,\left|\Phi_{0}^{\uparrow} \Phi_{1}^{\downarrow}\right\rangle$ and $\left|\Phi_{1}^{\uparrow} \Phi_{1}^{\downarrow}\right\rangle$. In the panels, the blue and yellow dots, respectively, stand for electrons and photons. The vertical red dashed line in panel (a) indicates a significant distance between the cavities.

bond is broken, phonon need to be absorbed. Both the association and the dissociation reactions can be interpreted by this model. Each energy level in the molecularatomic system - both atomic and molecular - is divided into two levels, spin up and spin down, denoted by the signs ↑ and ↓ , respectively. There will now be twice as many levels, and the Pauli exclusion principle [50] dictates that each level can only contain one electron. The excited states of the electron with the spins for the first nucleus are indicated by $\left|0_{1}^{\uparrow}\right\rangle_{e}$ and $\left|0_{1}^{\downarrow}\right\rangle_{e}$. Usually simply written as $\left|0_{1}\right\rangle_{e}$, which can denote both $\left|0_{1}^{\uparrow}\right\rangle_{e}$ and $\left|0_{1}^{\downarrow}\right\rangle_{e}$. For the second nucleus $-\left|0_{2}\right\rangle_{e}$. Hybridization is impossible when two atoms are in different cavities (see Fig. 1 (a)). Only when two atoms are in the same cavity, orbital hybridization is possible (see Fig. 1 (b)).

Hybrid molecular states of the electron are denoted by

$$
\begin{align*}
\left|\Phi_{1}\right\rangle_{e} & =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\left|0_{1}\right\rangle_{e}-\left|0_{2}\right\rangle_{e}\right)  \tag{1a}\\
\left|\Phi_{0}\right\rangle_{e} & =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\left|0_{1}\right\rangle_{e}+\left|0_{2}\right\rangle_{e}\right) \tag{1b}
\end{align*}
$$

where $\left|\Phi_{1}\right\rangle_{e}$ is molecular excited state, $\left|\Phi_{0}\right\rangle_{e}$ is molecular ground state. On the contrary, we can get the atomic state after orbital de-hybridization

$$
\begin{align*}
\left|0_{1}\right\rangle_{e} & =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\left|\Phi_{0}\right\rangle_{e}+\left|\Phi_{1}\right\rangle_{e}\right)  \tag{2a}\\
\left|0_{2}\right\rangle_{e} & =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\left|\Phi_{0}\right\rangle_{e}-\left|\Phi_{1}\right\rangle_{e}\right) \tag{2b}
\end{align*}
$$

The Hilbert space of quantum states of the entire system, having the following form

$$
\begin{equation*}
|\Psi\rangle_{\mathcal{C}}=\left|p_{1}\right\rangle_{\Omega^{\uparrow}}\left|p_{2}\right\rangle_{\Omega^{\downarrow}}|m\rangle_{\omega}\left|l_{1}\right\rangle_{\Phi_{1}^{\uparrow}}\left|l_{2}\right\rangle_{\Phi_{1}^{\downarrow}}|L\rangle_{c b}|k\rangle_{n} \tag{3}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $p_{1}, p_{2}$ are the numbers of molecular photons with modes $\Omega^{\uparrow}, \Omega^{\downarrow}$, respectively; $m$ is the number of phonons with mode $\omega . l_{1}, l_{2}$ describe orbital state: $l_{1}=1-$ electron with spin ↑ in excited orbital $\Phi_{1}^{\uparrow}, l_{1}=0-$ electron with spin ↑ in ground orbital $\Phi_{0}^{\uparrow} ; l_{2}=1-$ electron with spin ↓ in excited orbital $\Phi_{1}^{\downarrow}, l_{2}=0-$ electron with spin ↓ in ground orbital $\Phi_{0}^{\downarrow}$. The states of the covalent bond are denoted by $|L\rangle_{c b}: L=0$ - covalent bond formation, $L=1$ - covalent bond breaking. The states of the nuclei are denoted by $|k\rangle_{n}: k=0$ - state of nuclei, gathering together in one cavity, $k=1$ - state of nuclei, scattering in different cavities.

$$
\begin{align*}
H & =\hbar \Omega^{\uparrow} a_{\Omega^{\uparrow}}^{\dagger} a_{\Omega^{\uparrow}}+\hbar \Omega^{\downarrow} a_{\Omega^{\downarrow}}^{\dagger} a_{\Omega^{\downarrow}}+\hbar \omega a_{\omega}^{\dagger} a_{\omega} \\

\end{align*}
$$

where $\hbar=h / 2 \pi$ is the reduced Planck constant. $g$ is the coupling strength between the photon or phonon (with annihilation and creation operators $a$ and $a^{\dagger}$, respectively) and the electron in the molecule (with excitation and relaxation operators $\sigma^{\dagger}$ and $\sigma$, respectively). $g_{\Omega^{\uparrow}}$ is the coupling strength for the photon mode $\Omega^{\uparrow}, g_{\Omega^{\downarrow}}$ is the coupling strength for the photon mode $\Omega^{\downarrow}, g_{\omega}$ is the strength of formation or breaking of covalent bond, $\zeta$ is the tunneling intensity. $\sigma_{\omega} \sigma_{\omega}^{\dagger}$ verifies that covalent bond is formed.

\end{align*}
$$

## III. NUMERICAL METHOD

## A. Precise time step integration method

We use the density matrix $\rho$ to obtain the unitary evolution of the non-dissipative system. The solution $\rho(t)$ may be approximately found as follows

$$
\begin{equation*}
\rho(t+d t)=\exp \left(-\frac{i}{\hbar} H d t\right) \rho(t) \exp \left(\frac{i}{\hbar} H d t\right) \tag{14}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $H$ is defined in Eq. (4), and

$$
\begin{equation*}
\rho(t=0)=\left|\Psi_{\text {initial }}\right\rangle\left\langle\Psi_{\text {initial }}\right| \tag{15}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\left|\Psi_{\text {initial }}\right\rangle$ is defined in Eq. (12).
In addition to being crucial for solving differential equations, the matrix exponential is also important for control theory, transportation and waveguides. The articles [51, 52 has examined 19 different ways to compute the matrix exponential and their drawbacks, and the fact that the exponential problem has not yet been fully resolved illustrates how important it is. Zhong Wanxie proposed the precise time step integration method (PTSIM) of matrix exponential in 1991 [53]. This method avoids computer truncation errors caused by fine division and improves the numerical solution of matrix exponential to computer accuracy. This method was quickly applied to solving mathematical and physical problems [54-57. When solving the equations of motion using stepwise integration, the matrix exponential operation involved is $e^{A \Delta t}$. According to the addition theorem of matrix exponential

$$
\begin{equation*}
e^{A \Delta t}=\left[e^{A \frac{\Delta t}{2^{N}}}\right]^{2^{N}}=\left[e^{A \varepsilon}\right]^{2^{N}} \tag{16}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $A$ is matrix, $\Delta t$ is time step, $\varepsilon=\frac{\Delta t}{2^{N}}$ (usually $N$ is taken to be equal to 20 ). The matrix exponential can be approximated using Taylor series expansion ( 4 terms)

$$
\begin{equation*}
e^{A \varepsilon} \approx I+A \varepsilon+\frac{(A \varepsilon)^{2}}{2!}+\frac{(A \varepsilon)^{3}}{3!}+\frac{(A \varepsilon)^{4}}{4!} \tag{17}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $I$ is unit matrix, then

$$
\begin{align*}
e^{A \Delta t} & \approx\left[I+A \varepsilon+\frac{(A \varepsilon)^{2}}{2!}+\frac{(A \varepsilon)^{3}}{3!}+\frac{(A \varepsilon)^{4}}{4!}\right]^{2^{N}}  \tag{18}\\
& =\left[I+T_{a, 0}\right]^{2^{N}}
\end{align*}
$$

where $T_{a, 0}=A \varepsilon+\frac{(A \varepsilon)^{2}}{2!}+\frac{(A \varepsilon)^{3}}{3!}+\frac{(A \varepsilon)^{4}}{4!}$, then

$$
\begin{align*}
{\left[I+T_{a, 0}\right]^{2^{N}} } & =\left[\left(I+T_{a, 0}\right)^{2}\right]^{2^{N-1}} \\
& =\left[I+2 T_{a, 0}+T_{a, 0} T_{a, 0}\right]^{2^{N-1}} \\
& =\left[I+T_{a, 1}\right]^{2^{N-1}}  \tag{19}\\
& =\left[I+T_{a, 2}\right]^{2^{N-2}} \\
& \cdots \cdots \\
& =\left[I+T_{a, N}\right]
\end{align*}
$$

where $T_{a, n}=2 T_{a, n-1}+T_{a, n-1} T_{a, n-1}$. The above calculation process avoids operations between values with large differences in magnitude and avoids the impact of rounding errors.

## B. Quantum entropy

For a bipartite system, we set the observed subsystem as $\mathcal{A}$ and the unobserved subsystem as $\mathcal{B}$. We exclusively address the entanglement in the non-dissipative situation in simulations. Quantum entropy was first introduced by von Neumann [2. Its status is equivalent to that of Shannon entropy in classical information theory. It is the most basic and important concept in the fields of quantum information and quantum communication. From a thermodynamic point of view, the entropy of a closed system is a time-independent constant. This means that if a closed system is prepared in a pure (mixed) state, it will remain in a pure (mixed) state during the time evolution. But people are more interested in the interaction between a system and its surrounding environment, or the interaction between subsystems in a system. The density matrix describing the whole system cannot directly display the dynamics of each subsystem, so a statistical operator is needed to describe the subsystem. This is the reduced density operator of the subsystem, which can define the entropy of the subsystem and describe the dynamics of the subsystem. The von Neumann entropy of reduced density matrix, which is used to measure quantum correlation 58, 59, can be used directly when the quantum system is closed and the entire system is in the pure state $\mid$ pure $\rangle$. However, in this case, it can also be thought of as the entropy of entanglement. In this case, due to the Schmidt decomposition, the von Neumann entropy of each of two subsystems $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ can be used as a gauge of the system's entanglement 60

$$
\begin{equation*}
E=S(\mathcal{A})=S(\mathcal{B}) \tag{20}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $S(\mathcal{A}), S(\mathcal{B})$ are corresponding to $\rho_{\mathcal{A}}, \rho_{\mathcal{B}}$, respectively. And $\rho_{\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{B})}$ - reduction of density matrix $\rho_{\mathcal{A} \mathcal{B}}=\mid$ pure $\rangle\langle$ pure $|$, which is the density matrix of whole system, has the following form

$$
\begin{align*}
\rho_{\mathcal{A}} & =\operatorname{Tr}_{\mathcal{B}}\left(\rho_{\mathcal{A B}}\right) \\
& =\sum_{b}\left(I_{\mathcal{A}} \otimes\left\langle\left. b\right|_{\mathcal{B}}\right) \rho_{\mathcal{A B}}\left(I_{\mathcal{A}} \otimes|b\rangle_{\mathcal{B}}\right)\right.  \tag{21a}\\
\rho_{\mathcal{B}} & =\operatorname{Tr}_{\mathcal{A}}\left(\rho_{\mathcal{A B}}\right) \\
& =\sum_{a}\left(\left\langle\left. a\right|_{\mathcal{A}} \otimes I_{\mathcal{B}}\right) \rho_{\mathcal{A B}}\left(|a\rangle_{\mathcal{A}} \otimes I_{\mathcal{B}}\right)\right. \tag{21b}
\end{align*}
$$

where $\operatorname{Tr}_{\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B}}$ represents the trace operation on the variables of the subsystem.

In quantum theory, the definition of von Neumann entropy of reduced density matrix $\rho_{\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{B})}$, called quantum reduced entropy, is as follows

$$
\begin{equation*}
S(\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{B}))=-\operatorname{Tr}\left(\rho_{\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{B})} \log _{2} \rho_{\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{B})}\right) \tag{22}
\end{equation*}
$$

In terms of eigenvalues, we have

$$
\begin{equation*}
S(\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{B}))=-\sum_{i} \lambda_{i}^{\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{B})} \log _{2} \lambda_{i}^{\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{B})} \tag{23}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\lambda_{i}^{\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{B})}$ - eigenvalues of density matrix $\rho_{\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{B})} .0 \leq S(\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{B})) \leq \log _{2} N, N=2^{n}, N$ - Hilbert space dimension, $n$ - number of qubits of subsystem. $S(\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{B}))=0$ - separable state, $S(\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{B}))>0$ - entangled state, $S(\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{B}))=\log _{2} N-$ maximum entangled state.

## IV. SIMULATIONS AND RESULTS

In all simulations: $\hbar=1, \Omega^{\uparrow}=\Omega^{\downarrow}=10^{9}, \omega= 10^{8}, g=10^{7}$.

## A. Effect of interactions on entropy

We divide the whole system into the following two subsystems

$$
\begin{equation*}
|\Psi\rangle_{\mathcal{C}}=\underbrace{\left|p_{1}\right\rangle_{\Omega^{\uparrow}}\left|p_{2}\right\rangle_{\Omega^{\downarrow}}}_{\mathcal{A}} \underbrace{|m\rangle_{\omega}\left|l_{1}\right\rangle_{\Phi_{1}^{\uparrow}}\left|l_{2}\right\rangle_{\Phi_{1}^{\downarrow}}|L\rangle_{c b}|k\rangle_{n}}_{\mathcal{B}} \tag{24}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\mathcal{A}$ is a subsystem composed of photons, $\mathcal{B}$ is a system composed of matter. We define $S_{\Omega, \omega}=S(\mathcal{A})= S(\mathcal{B})$. We will study the effect of different values of $g_{\Omega}, g_{\omega}, \zeta$ on entropy $S_{\Omega, \omega}$.

Firstly, we focus on the effect of $g_{\Omega}$ on entropy. We suppose $g_{\omega}=0.1 g, \zeta=g$. Four different values of $g_{\Omega}$ are $g, \frac{3}{2} g, 2 g$ and $4 g$. In Fig. 2 (a), we find that the greater the strength, the lower the peak value of entropy. When $g_{\Omega}$ equal to $g$, the peak value is approximately equal to 1 , and when $g_{\Omega}$ is equal to $4 g$, the peak value is close to 0 . And in the four cases, the wave packets of entropy are not synchronized. In Fig. 2 (b~e), we study the envelope

of wave packet. We find that the greater the strength, the shorter the period of the envelope of the wave packet.

Secondly, we focus on the effect of $g_{\omega}$ on entropy. We suppose $g_{\Omega}=g, \zeta=g$. Four different values of $g_{\omega}$ are $\frac{1}{100} g, \frac{1}{20} g, \frac{1}{10} g$ and $\frac{1}{5} g$. In Fig. 3 (a), we find that different from Fig. 2 (a), the oscillation frequencies of the entropy wave packets in these four cases are synchronized. In Fig. 3 ( $\mathrm{b} \sim \mathrm{e}$ ), we find that peak value in these four cases are the same and all equal to 1 . However,
the envelopes of wave packet are different. Obviously, the length of the period of envelope is strictly inversely proportional to the size of value of $g_{\omega}$.

Thirdly, we focus on the effect of $\zeta$ on entropy. We suppose $g_{\Omega}=g, g_{\omega}=\frac{1}{10} g$. Four different values of $\zeta$ are $\frac{1}{10} g, \frac{1}{2} g, g$ and $\frac{3}{2} g$. In Fig. 4 (a), in the four cases, the wave packets of entropy are not synchronized. In Fig. 4 ( $\mathrm{b} \sim \mathrm{e}$ ), we find that the peak value of entropy changes with the change of value of $\zeta$, and when $\zeta=g$, the peak

FIG. 4. (online color) Effect of different tunneling intensities $\zeta$ on entropy. The magenta, green, red and blue curves, respectively, stand for different intensities.

value reaches a maximum of 1 . In addition, the length of the period of envelope also changes with the change of value of $\zeta$.

Now we find that both electron transition strength and tunneling strength can affect the peak value of entropy, so we study the effect of these two parameters on the peak value at the same time, and get Fig. 5. There are two obvious ridges on this figure. One is when $g_{\Omega}=\zeta$, the local peak value obtained on this ridge is equal to 1 , the other is when $g_{\Omega}=2 \zeta$, the local peak value obtained on the ridge is greater than 1 . Interestingly, when we plot the time evolution curves of the above two cases, we get two different wave packet types, shown in Figs. 6 and 7, respectively.

## B. Comparison of entropy of different subsystems

We assume the following three situations

$$
\begin{equation*}
|\Psi\rangle_{\mathcal{C}}=\underbrace{\left|p_{1}\right\rangle_{\Omega^{\dagger}}}_{\mathcal{A}} \underbrace{\left|p_{2}\right\rangle_{\Omega^{\downarrow}}|m\rangle_{\omega}\left|l_{1}\right\rangle_{\Phi_{1}^{\dagger}}\left|l_{2}\right\rangle_{\Phi_{1}^{\downarrow}}|L\rangle_{c b}|k\rangle_{n}}_{\mathcal{B}} \tag{25}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\mathcal{A}$ is a subsystem composed of photon with mode $\Omega^{\uparrow}$, and

$$
\begin{equation*}
|\Psi\rangle_{\mathcal{C}}=\underbrace{\left|p_{1}\right\rangle_{\Omega^{\uparrow}}}_{\mathcal{B}} \underbrace{\left|p_{2}\right\rangle_{\Omega^{\downarrow}}}_{\mathcal{A}} \underbrace{|m\rangle_{\omega}\left|l_{1}\right\rangle_{\Phi_{1}^{\uparrow}}\left|l_{2}\right\rangle_{\Phi_{1}^{\downarrow}}|L\rangle_{c b}|k\rangle_{n}}_{\mathcal{B}} \tag{26}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\mathcal{A}$ is a subsystem composed of photon with mode $\Omega^{\downarrow}$, and

$$
\begin{equation*}
|\Psi\rangle_{\mathcal{C}}=\underbrace{\left|p_{1}\right\rangle_{\Omega^{\uparrow}}\left|p_{2}\right\rangle_{\Omega^{\downarrow}}}_{\mathcal{B}} \underbrace{|m\rangle_{\omega}}_{\mathcal{A}} \underbrace{\left|l_{1}\right\rangle_{\Phi_{1}^{\uparrow}}\left|l_{2}\right\rangle_{\Phi_{1}^{\downarrow}}|L\rangle_{c b}|k\rangle_{n}}_{\mathcal{B}} \tag{27}
\end{equation*}
$$

where $\mathcal{A}$ is a subsystem composed of phonon with mode $\omega$. We define $S_{\Omega^{\uparrow}}, S_{\Omega^{\downarrow}}, S_{\omega}$ are entropies corresponding to photon with mode $\Omega^{\uparrow}$, photon with mode $\Omega^{\downarrow}$ and phonon with mode $\omega$, respectively.

In Fig. 8 (a), $S_{\Omega^{\uparrow}}$ always coincides with $S_{\Omega^{\downarrow}}$ since our quantum system is symmetrical. We get the following formula $S_{\Omega^{\uparrow}}+S_{\Omega^{\downarrow}}>S_{\Omega}>S_{\Omega^{\uparrow}}=S_{\Omega^{\downarrow}}$. The result satis-

fies that the sum of the entropies of the two subsystems is greater than the entropy of the whole system. In Fig. 8 (b), $S_{\Omega^{\uparrow}}+S_{\Omega^{\downarrow}}, S_{\Omega}, S_{\Omega^{\uparrow}}, S_{\Omega^{\downarrow}}$ are all synchronized.

In Fig. 9, we found that entropic dynamics of photons is different from that of phonon. However, The envelopes

of wave packets have the same period.

## V. CONCLUDING DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK

In this paper, we explore various aspects of entropy of a complicated cavity QED system. The entropic dynamics has been constructed, and several analytical findings have been drawn from it:

In Sec. IV A. we proved that $g_{\Omega}$ and $\zeta$ affect the peak value of entropy, and that they have a linear relationship between $g_{\Omega}$ and $\zeta$ where the local maximum of the peak value is obtained. In addition, $g_{\Omega}, g_{\omega}$ and $\zeta$ can all affect the period of the wave packet envelope. Next in Sec. IV B, we compared the entropic dynamics between different photons and between photons and phonon.

FIG. 9. (online color) Comparison of von Neumann entropy between photonic state and phononic state. $S_{\omega}$ is entropy of phonon with mode $\omega$.

We tried to study the characteristics of entropy on a seven-cubit complex quantum system and obtained some regular results. These results lay the foundation for our future studies of more complex quantum model entropy dynamics.
